***Coffea canephora*** (especially ***C. canephora var. robusta***, so predominantly cultivated that it is often simply termed ***Coffea robusta***, or commonly **robusta coffee**) is a species of coffee plant that has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is a species of flowering plant in the family "Family (biology)") Rubiaceae. Though widely known as *Coffea robusta*, the plant is scientifically identified as *Coffea canephora*, which has two main varieties, *robusta* and *nganda*.

*Coffea robusta* represents between 40% and 45% of global coffee production, with *Coffea arabica* constituting most of the remainder. There are several differences between the composition of coffee beans from *C. arabica* and *C. robusta*. Beans from *C. robusta* tend to have lower acidity, more bitterness, and a more woody and less fruity flavor compared to *C. arabica* beans. Most of it is used for instant coffee.

## Taxonomy

Though widely known by the synonym "Synonym (taxonomy)") *Coffea robusta*, the plant is currently scientifically identified as *Coffea canephora*, which has two main varieties, *C. c. robusta* and *C. c. nganda*. It was not recognized as a species of *Coffea* until 1897, over a hundred years after *Coffea arabica*.

## Description

Clusters of Robusta coffee flowers

Robusta is a species of flowering plant in the family "Family (biology)") Rubiaceae. The plant has a shallow root system and grows as a robust tree or shrub to about 10 metres (30 feet) tall. It flowers irregularly, taking about 10–11 months for the berries "Berry (botany)") to ripen, producing oval-shaped beans.

The robusta plant has a greater crop yield than that of arabica, contains more caffeine (2.7% compared to arabica's 1.5%), and contains less sugar (3–7% compared to arabica's 6–9%). As it is less susceptible to pests and disease, robusta needs much less herbicide and pesticide than arabica.

## Native distribution

*C. canephora* grows indigenously in Western and Central Africa from Liberia to Tanzania and south to Angola. It is also reportedly naturalized "Naturalization (biology)") in Borneo, French Polynesia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Jamaica and the Lesser Antilles. In 1927 a hybrid between robusta and arabica was found in Timor. This strain was subsequently used to breed coffee rust-resistant plants.

## Cultivation and use

Coffee made from beans of the *Coffea canephora* plant has low acidity and high bitterness, often with a distinct woody and nutty taste. *C. canephora* beans, widely known by the synonym *Coffea robusta*, are used primarily in instant coffee, espresso, and as a filler in ground coffee blends.*[citation needed*]

Robusta has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is easy to care for, has a greater crop yield, has almost double the amount of caffeine and more antioxidants, and is less susceptible to disease than arabica coffea. It represents 43% of global coffee production, with arabica constituting the remainder except for the 1.5% constituted by *Coffea liberica*.

It is mostly grown in Vietnam, where French colonists introduced it in the late 19th century, though it is also grown in India, Africa, and in Brazil, where the *conilon* variety is widely grown. In recent years,*[when?*] Vietnam, which produces mostly robusta, has become the world's largest exporter of robusta coffee, accounting for over 40% of the total production. It surpasses Brazil (25% of the world's production), Indonesia (13%), India (5%), and Uganda (5%). Brazil is still the biggest coffee producer in the world, producing one-third of the world's coffee, though 69% of that is *C. arabica*.

Since Robusta is easier to care for and has a greater crop yield than *C. arabica*, it is cheaper to produce. Roasted robusta beans produce a strong, full-bodied coffee with a distinctive earthy flavour, but usually with more bitterness than arabica due to its pyrazine content. Since arabica beans are presumed to have smoother taste with more acidity and a richer flavour, they are often considered superior, while the harsher robusta beans are mostly used as a filler in lower-grade coffee blends. However, the powerful flavour can be desirable in a blend to give it perceived "strength" and "finish", notably in Italian coffee culture. Good-quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends, at about 10–15%, to provide a full-bodied taste and a better foam head (known as *crema*). It is also used as a stimulant, diuretic, antioxidant, and antipyretic and relieves spasmodic asthma.*[failed verification*]
