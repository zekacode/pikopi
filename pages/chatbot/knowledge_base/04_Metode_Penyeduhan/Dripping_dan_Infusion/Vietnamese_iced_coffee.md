## History

See also: History of coffee production in Vietnam

Coffee was introduced to Vietnam in 1857 by a French Catholic priest in the form of a single *Coffea arabica* tree. The beverage was adopted with regional variations. Because of limitations on the availability of fresh milk, as the dairy farming industry was still in its infancy, the French and Vietnamese began to use sweetened condensed milk with a dark roast coffee.

Vietnam did not become a major exporter of coffee until the Đổi Mới reforms and opening of the economy after the war. Now, many coffee farms exist across the Central Highlands. Vietnam is now the largest producer of the Robusta variety of coffee and the second largest producer of coffee worldwide.
